# An Introduction to me

Hello, I'm Liam.  As a data analyst, I mostly create dashboards that increase the business capabilities of internal customers by given them insights into the data they previously didn't have access to.  

Other things I have done: created API data connections to external sources; designed a data governance strategy for a data warehouse that requires standardized naming of columns across production database tables, documentation for all production database objects, and code ownership and change logging; and built a data warehouse following that data governance strategy.

## My process for data analysis / making data products
For data analytics, I follow iterative P.A.C.E. project lifecycle:
<ul>
  <li>
    Plan: gather project requirements.  Talk with internal customers of project deliverables about the motivations behind the project, the "Why" that drove the internal customer(s) to request a report to be  made.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analysis: conduct exploratory data analysis.  For data products, this means using my knowledge of the busienss to find the data needed for the outlined business capabilities in the project requirments. 
For a quick analysis to answer a business question, I look for as many insights as are relevant to the requested information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Construct: finalize the viualizations of the data product, or pair down insights to a valuable few.
</il>
  <li>
    Execute: present the insights / data product to internal customers, get feedback, and make any changes if necessary
  </li>
</ul>
